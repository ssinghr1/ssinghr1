## <u>Hey! I'm Shamtej 👋⛱️</u>
I'm a current undergraduate student studying CS and Neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University and a research assistant at the Knierim Lab @ JHU. 

This repo holds all my personal and professional projects over the last few years, and is where I'll be working on projects going forward.
